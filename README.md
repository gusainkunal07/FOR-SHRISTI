    <h1>To the Love of My Life</h1>
    
    <h2>My Dearest Shristi,</h2>
    <p>
        From the moment I met you, my world changed forever. There are no words that can truly capture how much I love you, 
        but I’ll keep trying. Every day with you feels like a beautiful dream, and every moment we share is a treasure to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not just the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever laid eyes on, but your heart, your soul, and the kindness you show 
        to others make you even more beautiful. You light up my life, and I feel incredibly lucky to call you mine.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can’t wait to see where life takes us, but I know I want to spend every step of that journey by your side.
    </p>
